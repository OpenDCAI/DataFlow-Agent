Let's go through each step with further elaboration:\n\n1. **Identify Key Components and Premises:**\n   - **Urbanization** is defined as the migration of people from rural areas to urban centers. \n   - **Opportunities** associated with urbanization include employment opportunities and access to cultural activities, which tend to be more abundant in cities.\n   - **Challenges** are characterized by the negative aspects, such as congestion, pollution, and housing shortages that cities often face as they grow.\n\n2. **Apply Relevant Principles, Theorems, or Methods:**\n   - **Urban Growth Theory**: Explains urbanization through push-pull factors:\n     - **Push Factors**: Conditions in rural areas, such as limited jobs and resources, pushing people to leave.\n     - **Pull Factors**: Attractions in urban areas, such as better jobs, education, and lifestyle, drawing people in.\n   - **Economic Theory of Agglomeration**: Discusses how cities create efficiencies by concentrating resources and people, which can lead to economic benefits. However, agglomeration can also lead to negative outcomes, such as increased pollution and congestion.\n   - **Housing Market Theory**: As more people migrate to urban areas, demand for housing increases. If the supply doesn't keep up due to constraints (e.g., zoning, availability of land), prices rise, leading to shortages.\n\n3. **Perform Calculations or Logical Checks:**\n   - **Logical Relationship**: Assessing whether urban pull factors consistently outweigh rural push factors, confirming the ongoing trend of migration.\n   - **Verification of Externalities**: Confirming that higher urban density naturally increases issues like congestion and pollution, as more people and vehicles put pressure on infrastructure and the environment.\n   - **Demand-Supply Analysis**: Examining how increasing demand for housing, coupled with rigid supply, leads to higher prices and shortages.\n\n4. **Present the Final Conclusion:**\n   - Urbanization results in both opportunities and challenges.
